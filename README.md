# GD-Bypass-hacks

You need a mod loader to work this mod!<br>
This library may be needed by many GDPS and fan games,
### It can save you from:
- checking the integrity of the main level (Load Failed inscription and kick)
- departure at the end of the level when it is difficult but short
- restrictions on the number of objects in the level
- character filter
- text length restrictions
- restrictions on the maximum number of original songs
### And also:
- Pulsing objects in music beat on practice mode
- Allows you to rotate any object (collision remains the same)
- broken scroll (Allows you to scroll for the specified maximum or minimum)
